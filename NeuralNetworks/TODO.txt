implement automatic dimensions 
visualize the architecture of the network
gif of weights in learning
write tests 
move the code to a separate file

visualization ideas:
- different accuracy of calculating numerically the gradient
- numerically calculated gradient vs. backpropagated gradient epoch and time mse 
- shuffle the data and see how the accuracy changes
- different optimizers
- different learning rates
- different batch sizes
- different initializations methods
- different activation functions
- bias == 0 vs bias != 0

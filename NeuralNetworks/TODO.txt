implement automatic dimensions 
visualize the architecture of the network
write tests 
move the code to a separate file

visualization ideas:
- different accuracy of calculating numerically the gradient
- numeracly calculated gradient vs. backpropagated gradient epoch and time mse 
- schuffle the data and see how the accuracy changes

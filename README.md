# Neural Networks Implementation

This repository contains a basic implementation of neural networks using numpy and pandas. The neural networks are implemented from scratch, including forward and backward propagation.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains datasets for both classification and regression tasks.
- `NeuralNetworks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts related to the neural networks implementation.
  - `backpropagation.ipynb`: A notebook demonstrating backpropagation.
  - `optimizators.ipynb`: A notebook demonstrating generic optimization methods.
  - `implementation/`: This directory contains the Python scripts for the neural network implementation.
  - `NN1.ipynb` and `NN2.ipynb`: Notebooks demonstrating the neural network implementation.
  - `shuffle_vs_no_shuffle.ipynb`: A notebook comparing the effects of shuffling the data before training.
  - `visualisations.ipynb`: A notebook for visualizing the neural networks.

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
To use the neural network implementation, import the NeuralNetwork class from NeuralNetworks/implementation/neural_network.py. See the Jupyter notebooks in the NeuralNetworks/ directory for examples of how to use the class.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss your ideas before making a pull request.
